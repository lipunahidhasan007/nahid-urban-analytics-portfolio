# Urban Analytics & Data Science Portfolio — Nahid Hasan Lipu

This repository showcases selected coursework and projects from my Master of Applied Technologies (Computing) at Unitec (Auckland), with a focus on **machine learning**, **data integration**, and **dashboarding** relevant to **urban analytics** and housing data.

## Highlights
- **Employee Performance Prediction (ML, Python, XGBoost/Random Forest)** — end‑to‑end classification pipeline with fairness‑aware preprocessing and feature importance.
- **Data Warehousing & Big Data** — (placeholder) dimensional modelling & ELT/ETL with SQL/PostgreSQL; to be added.
- **Dashboards** — (placeholder) interactive prototypes (Power BI / Python) with maps, filters, and drill‑downs; to be added.

> ⚠️ Private datasets used for coursework are not redistributed. Public dataset links and reproducible scripts/notebooks are provided where permitted.
