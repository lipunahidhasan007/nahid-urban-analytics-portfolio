# How to Add Dashboard Screenshots & PBIX

## Screenshots
- Export key visuals from Power BI (KPI row, resignations by department, hiring trend, satisfaction by job title, salary vs performance).
- Save as PNGs (e.g., `kpi_cards.png`, `resignations_by_dept.png`, `hiring_trend.png`, `satisfaction_by_role.png`, `salary_vs_performance.png`).
- Place them under this `/docs/` folder and reference them in the READMEs.

## PBIX
- Option A (Preferred): Upload the `.pbix` to Google Drive/OneDrive and share a **view-only link** in the README.
- Option B: Publish a **GitHub Release** and attach the `.pbix` binary there.
- Note: `.pbix` files are gitignored by default to keep the repo lightweight.
